# CheckinMe HR AI Assistant

## 1. Project Overview

This project implements an HR AI Assistant designed to handle employee-related queries across multiple HR domains. The system is built using the Gemini API and follows a modular, agent-based architecture.

The assistant supports queries related to:

- Attendance management  
- Leave requests and balances  
- Payroll and salary inquiries  
- Employee scheduling  
- Field operations (GPS tracking, mobile staff activity)  

The system integrates structured prompt engineering and context-aware response generation to simulate real-world HR assistance in a scalable and maintainable manner.

## 2. System Architecture

The system is designed using a root agent that delegates tasks to specialized sub-agents based on the query domain.

### High-Level Flow

```
root_agent (CheckinMe HR Assistant)
    ├── AttendanceAgent   → check-in/out,QR codes,overtime,Telegram alerts
    ├── LeaveAgent        → leave requests, balances, approvals
    ├── PayrollAgent      → salary, payroll runs, deductions
    └── FieldAgent        → GPS tracking, field activity for sales teams
```

### Architectural Design

- The **Root Agent** acts as the central controller  
- Each **Sub-Agent** is responsible for a specific HR domain  
- Tools provide domain-specific logic and sample data  
- The LLM generates responses based on structured prompts and injected context

## 5. Context Management

The system uses structured prompt engineering to ensure consistent and accurate responses.

### Prompt Structure

- System Instruction (HR Assistant role)
- Domain-Specific Context (HR data)
- User Query

`NOTE`: The instruction & data i provided to Agent are just a sample which i got from the AI as well but all are aligned with the CheckinMe features & contexts.

This approach ensures responses are grounded in relevant HR policies and reduces hallucination.

- Agent-based task delegation  
- Context-aware response generation  
- Modular and extensible design
